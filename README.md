#  MNIST Digit Classifier using NumPy

This project implements a **basic feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** (0–9).

It trains on pixel values from the dataset and predicts which digit is present in the image.

- Single hidden-layer neural network
- Activation: Sigmoid
- Output: Argmax (for class label)
- Training and testing on `.csv` versions of MNIST dataset
- Prints model performance after testing
